We'll do some preprocessing first, by lowercasing everything and add `<s>` (start) and `</s>` (end) symbols at the beginning and end of each sentence. For bigrams, we are using dictionaries of dictionaries with the strings as keys, which is a convenient though not particularly memory efficient way to represent things. We will use the unigram counts later for doing smoothing."

In order to do that for anything but toy examples, however, we will need to smooth our models so it doesn't assign a zero probability to the sentence whenever it sees a bigram. Here, we'll test two fairly simple smoothing techniques, add-*k* smoothing and interpolated smoothing. In both cases, we will calculate the log probability, to avoid working with very small numbers. The functions below give the probability for a single word at index i in a sentence.\n",

Estimating the probability of OOVs is a general problem: here we use an heuristic that uses a uniform distribution over all words in the vocabulary (1 / |V|)."
