      "\n",
      "WordNet was developed at Princeton University's Cognitive Science\n",
      "Laboratory under the direction of George Miller, James S. McDonnell\n",
      "Distinguished University Professor of Psychology, Emeritus. Over the\n",
      "years many linguists, lexicographers, students, and software engineers\n",
      "have contributed to the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "WordNet is an online lexical reference system.  Word forms in WordNet\n",
      "are represented in their familiar orthography; word meanings are\n",
      "represented by synonym sets (synsets) - lists of synonymous word forms\n",
      "that are interchangeable in some context.  Two kinds of relations are\n",
      "recognized: lexical and semantic.  Lexical relations hold between word\n",
      "forms; semantic relations hold between word meanings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "To learn more about WordNet, the book \"WordNet: An Electronic Lexical\n",

    "The shortest path does not always correspond to the most obvious relationship between two words: for instance, newspaper and book are join as products (not reading materials), dog and cat by informal senses related to people, rather than animals. Using depth and information-content basic metrics can improve this situation. Another approach is to use the counts of lemmas to ignore rare senses. Note that doing all this for other metrics is somewhat different, because they are based on the idea of lowest common subsumer, which is not necessarily on the shortest path."
