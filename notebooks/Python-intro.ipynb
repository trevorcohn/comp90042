Is is interpreted, rather than compiled, which means that you can see the results of a program (or program fragment) simply by using a terminal which can interpret the commands. (Like this one!) This property has made Python popular for certain web apps. On the other hand, because it isn't pre-compiled, Python programs often aren't as fast as equivalent C programs (for example).\n",
